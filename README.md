# UFOs

# Project overview


This project looks at JavaScript, its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization. JavaScript is a well-established coding
language designed to improve webpages by enhancing the user experience. JavaScript enhances websites by providing front-end functionality, customization, dashboards (such as maps or graphs), and allows for user input to create dynamic web pages. JavaScript enables websites to be visually appealing and interactive.
In this repository, a dynamic webpage would be built by inserting a JavaScript into an HTML page using CSS and Bootstrap and exploring Devtools to test the code. To begin, a table is created to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.


# Project Deliverables

Basic HTML, Bootstrap and CSS is used to build and style the entire page. The project is done as follows:

•	Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

•	A written report on the UFO analysis


# Resources

Visual Studio Code, JavaScript ES6


# Results

A dynamic webpage is created which allows users to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria at the same time. The table filters include date, city, sate, country and shape of UFO sightings.

In addition, displayed results are dynamically filtered as the form field entries are updated. The table updates in real time so it is not necessarily to submit or
refresh the page every time there is an input to be made. The Filter selection can be very broad as it can be narrowed to specifying the date of city in one state and
at the same time focusing on a different shape at the same time.


# Summary

This dynamic webpage allows users to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria at the same time. The table filters include date, city, sate, country and shape. With this webpage, every sighting would be available for Dana (and her readers) to view.
